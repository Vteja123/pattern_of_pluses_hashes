# pattern_of_pluses_hashes
Right-Angled Diamond Pattern Generator
This Python script generates a right-angled diamond pattern composed of "#" and "+" characters based on the user input for the size of the diamond. The diamond pattern is created using loops and conditional statements to print the appropriate characters at each row, resulting in a diamond shape where the "#" characters are aligned on the same line.

Usage
Run the script pattern_of_pluses_hashes.py .
Enter an integer value when prompted to specify the size of the diamond.
The script will generate and display the right-angled diamond pattern in the console.
Features
Allows the user to specify the size of the diamond pattern.
Prints a right-angled diamond pattern composed of "#" and "+" characters, with "#" characters aligned on the same line.
Handles both even and odd sizes of the diamond pattern.
Example
For input 5, the generated right-angled diamond pattern looks like this:
